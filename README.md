# Hello there & welcome to the code challenge

This is an open end coding challenge consisting of multiple parts designed to help us understand better your knowledge, process of thought and most importantly to provide the space for you to work out the solutions in your own unique way.

Although it is an open end challenge and it is not neccessary to complete all of the tasks, we have grouped them in two tiers to help with the prioritasation and emulate an actual day to day working situation in a modern software development team where balancing between deliverables, implementation and the software developer's wish to push forward with their own unique knowledge, skills and expertise.

## Challenges

---

This is a simple CRUD angular web application split in two "groups" of primary tasks which are required and a set of secondary tasks which is completely up to you if you would like to work on or not.
Some ideas of why or when to work the secondary tasks are

- If there is a topic that you are strong at it and you would like to apply your knowledge
- To test your some ideas or concepts that you would like to show and discuss in our code review meeting
- To show-off :)
- Just because...

## Required primary tasks

Please check the details for the required primary tasks [here](./docs/project_challenges.md)

### Optional secondary tasks

Details for the optional secondary tasks can be found [here](./docs/secondary_tasks.md)

## Workspace information

- [Reference Screenshots](./docs/reference.md)
- [Workspace Details, Setup, API Server etc](./docs/workspace.md)

## A few tips before you start

---

- There is no perfect solution neither hidden specific ways of doing something! Everything has pros and cons and is up to you to weight them up.
- Feel free to introduce your own coding style!
- You are more than welcome to refactor parts of the codebase as you see fit for solving the problems and if you do so we would love to know the why!
- Needless to say that stackoverflow, google and the documentation should be your best buddies in this challenge.
- Last but not least, every developer has some sort of "code signature". It might be tempting to follow the copy/pasta dogma but it is not what is this about. We would like to see how you do it and remember that solving all of the tasks is not the actual challenge!
